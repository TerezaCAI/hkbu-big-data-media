"I'm sure all the information sources I know about have already been mentioned. I will instead share a few simple things I wish somebody had told me:1. Don't stock up on components at the beginning. Only buy components that you need to build a chosen/designed circuit. Passive assortments contain useless stuff like many slightly different values of nanofarad capacitors. They will waste space in your parts storage.
1.1 Always keep your parts organized!2. Surface mount (components sit on top of circuit board) is not hard. For any thru-hole circuit (components have wires that pass through holes in the circuit board), the surface mount equivalent will be easy to solder. Only the surface mount chips with tons of pins, like 32-bit CPUs, are tricky. Those don't exist in thru-hole. Plus, if you start making PCBs, you won't have to drill holes in them.3. Classic op amps like the 741 and 358 suck. There are newer cheap op-amps that behave closer to the ideal model.4.

"I'm sure this article resonated with many engineers, not just from the game industry. What resonated with me the most, was the part about hiring a consultant, only to tell management what their employees have been telling them all along (for a ridiculous hourly rate of course). The simplified executive line of reasoning, why to rather trust an external entity over their own people, goes usually along these lines: ""We do not take advice from our employees. We hired them for grunt work and we only expect them to follow orders. What could they possibly know that could benefit our high-level decision making. Afterall we pay them so little"".I consider the case, which the author describes, where the consultant actually talks to engineers, a happy day scenario. I was witness to a fast growing startup hiring a well known global consulting firm to help them set up company structure and processes. The startup was unable to do this on its own because of lack of leadership and unwillingness of the owners to empower their own people. The consulting firm sent over a couple of their junior consultants who consulted their 3-ring binder of best practices for the nearest matching industry category and gave their recommendations, which were followed quite strictly by a newly hired junior management. All without talking to a single engineer.More often than not, employees are considered a necessary means to an end and treated as such, with the least amount of reward and care for which they are willing to work. Their sense of professional honor, responsibility and guilt is often exploited in an attempt to achieve higher output. Does the company's products or services suffer because of this? Of course, but nobody at the top cares as long as there is a metric that tells a good story. And when not, the lowest ranks are the first to be pruned and restructured.",martin_ky

"1. Just like any other startup, you're either paid salary or equity ( shares or options ) or some combination.  Salary is considered mostly risk-less, you get paid on some schedule and you're never going to lose more than a paycheck.  Equity is considerably more risky ( as the value of that equity can go to zero - in fact odds say that it will MOST LIKELY go to zero ), and for taking that risk, your potential upside should CONSIDERABLE so as to make that option a worthwhile endeavor.

child sex trafficking take place on its website than elsewhere. In 2011, in response
to a request from the Seattle Police Chief to require photo ID whenever a user
submits a photo for an ad, Padilla expressed doubt to Ferrer and Hyer that such a
system would be useful—it might create a “false sense of security.” But he went
on to add the following:And even if an age verification was a deterrent to someone
hoping to post an ad on Backpage to traffic a minor, it doesn’t
mean they’re going to stop trying to traffic a minor. It only
means they won’t be doing it on our site, where Backpage,
NCMEC and law enforcement are in the best position to put an
actual stop to the crime.""And another:""The record also contains substantial evidence that, as a matter of policy,
Backpage often chose to err against reporting potential child exploitation. As the
Subcommittee reported in connection with its November 2015 hearing, in June 2012
Backpage instructed its outsourced third-party moderators only to delete suspected
child-sex advertisements “IF YOU REALLY VERY SURE THE PERSON IS

Not only that, but music has the capacity to carry a story through time, from generation to generation, and thus the capacity to carry the morals of that story through time too.Maybe music is a way to disseminate important cultural information across a population and across time, and the societies that did not have music were weaker (eg. due to less shared morals across the society and across time) and therefore lost when they were confronted in battle by a society with music. If music is used in war to inspire courage in soldiers, perhaps it has a function beyond aesthetics and is actually used for survival, in a literal darwinian sense.",ibotty

"It would be nice to have some examples of what these terms mean, for type system dilletantes like me. I must say, I was a little lost :)Re: TypeScript:> TypeScript challenges the status quo, claiming that lowering the cognitive overhead of using types is more important than type soundness. They argue that JavaScript programmers, their main audience, would find it easier to use TypeScript if they deviated from traditional norms.Im not sure about the official mission statement, but as far as I understand, the purpose of their typesystem is to allow static description of the way existing JavaScript is typed, de facto, in the wild. This explains why e.g. literal strings are a type so you can do:    interface Eventor {
        on('foo', FooHandler);
        on('bar', BarHandler);
    }

Not because it’s nice to have a type that ""foo"" satisfies and not ""bar"", but because there is actual code out there that does this, today. Same for structural typing (TypeScript would be absolute horror to interface with existing code without it). And, I assume, covariant arrays.TypeScript was not created in a void, as a fresh, new typesystem. It was created to formalise the way existing JavaScript was informally typed. It would have been nice to see a little reference to or acknowledgement of this.Or an example of how this could have been achieved better; preserving type soundness.",toolslive

child sex trafficking take place on its website than elsewhere. In 2011, in response
to a request from the Seattle Police Chief to require photo ID whenever a user
submits a photo for an ad, Padilla expressed doubt to Ferrer and Hyer that such a
system would be useful—it might create a “false sense of security.” But he went
on to add the following:And even if an age verification was a deterrent to someone
hoping to post an ad on Backpage to traffic a minor, it doesn’t
mean they’re going to stop trying to traffic a minor. It only
means they won’t be doing it on our site, where Backpage,
NCMEC and law enforcement are in the best position to put an
actual stop to the crime.""And another:""The record also contains substantial evidence that, as a matter of policy,
Backpage often chose to err against reporting potential child exploitation. As the
Subcommittee reported in connection with its November 2015 hearing, in June 2012
Backpage instructed its outsourced third-party moderators only to delete suspected
child-sex advertisements “IF YOU REALLY VERY SURE THE PERSON IS
UNDERAGE.” In a similar email, a Backpage supervisor instructed internal
moderation staff: “Young ads do not get deleted unless they are clearly a
child.”""The whole report about ""knowingly facilitating"" sex trafficking is about them acknowledging the possibility that some people may be using the site for sex trafficking(which is just reality), and then questioning the demands of activists to ban a broad spectrum of ads because they may be related to child sex trafficking.Backpage was, quite clearly, trying to maintain its business of prostitution ads.

"Avoiding reading the news does not address a deeper problem: the way we think can be hijacked by people who know how.I am reminded of Blaise Pascal's ""Pensées"" from which I'll try to translate a passage:""Man is but a reed, the most feeble in nature; but he is a thinking reed. The universe need not entirely arm itself to crush him: a vapor, a drop of water suffices to kill him. But when the universe would crush him, Man would be even more noble than what kills him, because he knows he's dying, and the advantage the universe has on him, the universe knows none of it. Our dignity consists, then, in thought. It is from this that we must elevate ourselves and not from space or time, which we cannot fill. Let us work, then, to think well; this is the principle of morality.""Maybe we could look at it from this perspective. That avoiding the news is avoiding a channel we are aware of but not tackling the way we think makes us vulnerable to the channels we're unaware of that use the same mechanics.The intelligence community has a body of knowledge on this subject.

On SSD this is pretty crucial, because you can't wipe the contents by just writing random stuff on drive.

">Do you think the same intuition can be developed watching videos for things like woodworking?Absolutely, whether it's electronics, woodworking, cooking, mechanics, or whatever skill you choose, you can develop an intuition for a particular craft by watching others perform it. Even if it's not something inherently educational you'll still pick up bits and pieces of information, and things like technique and methods to approach a problem become evident the more you watch.If you're looking for some suggestions on woodworking channels, I wholeheartedly recommend Matthias Wandel[0], as well as John Heisz[1], as these channels are both very approachable and are often presented in a 'how to' fashion, providing plans for their work in the descriptions. There's no shortage to channels dedicated to teaching woodworking or home improvement if you just look for them, although some are less approachable than others, an example of this would be mtmwood[2] which is presented in Russian although knowing Russian is not necessary to understand the videos. He tends to make some pretty neat and complicated cutting boards[3].Although I must stress, don't skip the book learning with something like woodworking or home improvement, knowing how to operate power tools safely as well as taking personal protection seriously is absolutely essential.[0] https://www.youtube.com/user/Matthiaswandel[1] https://www.youtube.com/user/jpheisz[2] https://www.youtube.com/user/mtmwood[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVB5zjTraLk",lkurusa

You rely on the type-system to correct obvious mistakes, but not more.In Languages like Haskell or completely dependently typed languages it would be morally wrong (in my opinion) to have an unsound type-system. Here the role of the types is different, you use types to compute types and need to trust the compiler in complicated situations that this is sound, just like you trust the compiler to do correct floating arithmetic. Checking the types per hand may be a real challenge, for example if your writing super polymorphic code.

My favorite is OpenBSD, they invent the cybersecurity. They were one of the first to implement address randomization for kernel and library loading. This is actually strikingly similar to what goes on with the genome with retrotransposons during early embryology stages.People really like to repeatmask (aka SINE/introns) genomes because it makes BLAST go faster.

"I don't really think that unsound type systems are wrong, because I think it depends on the role of the types in the programming languages. Typescript, Java etc. don't have that sophisticated type systems and you can just check the types for yourself very quickly. You rely on the type-system to correct obvious mistakes, but not more.In Languages like Haskell or completely dependently typed languages it would be morally wrong (in my opinion) to have an unsound type-system. Here the role of the types is different, you use types to compute types and need to trust the compiler in complicated situations that this is sound, just like you trust the compiler to do correct floating arithmetic. Checking the types per hand may be a real challenge, for example if your writing super polymorphic code. Sometimes you even have to prove that your code fits the type-signature (per induction etc.), here you want guarantees.",xg15
"Here are some ideas:Look at the functional call stack. Its a slice of the linear address space that’s actively being used and it is strikingly similar to the promoter regions of the genome. Like some pathogens, hackers randomly try to hit that sweet spot that will jump to the special program.Operating systems are like simple biological organisms that evolve in response to various influences (cybersecurity it seems these days). My favorite is OpenBSD, they invent the cybersecurity. They were one of the first to implement address randomization for kernel and library loading. This is actually strikingly similar to what goes on with the genome with retrotransposons during early embryology stages.People really like to repeatmask (aka SINE/introns) genomes because it makes BLAST go faster. Ironically, arithmetic/statistical compression algorithms work really well with repeats (I don’t think this compressed state can be examined, but compression algorithms are seriously under appreciated).",osrec

2ndQuadrant is proud to announce the availability of BDR 2.0 running as an extension to community PostgreSQL 9.6 for its support customers. You can now make full use of the additional features offered with PostgreSQL 9.6 while using Multi-Master Replication from BDR, fully backed by 2ndQuadrant’s world renowned 24/7 Production Support. Fill out the contact form below to get in touch with us.This suggests to me it's not really open to the public. And there is no release 2.0 on github (https://github.com/2ndQuadrant/bdr/releases).Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong and the 2.0 release is accessible without a 2ndquadrant support contract (or reverse engineering the changes from the github repo branch, which pretty much ensures you're never going to production with it), I'm genuinely interested.",zbentley

"Well, in the attempt to make a snazzy graph the designer has actually obscured what the data show. People are used to the most desirable point being at a corner on this kind of thing, not in the middle of the side.Regarding what it's showing I have some real reservations about the satisfaction score. It's pretty subjective how happy a person is, and it's not actually that easy to translate the question into foreign languages. Just consider in English:- Are you happy?- Are you generally happy?- Are you satisfied with life?- Are you overjoyed?All these things mean something similar but cannot easily be translated to all other languages in the study.Plus there's a question of how people really think about the question. If I'm living in Scandinavia I will constantly be bombed with the results of this exact type of study. Maybe I won't think so hard when I consider what the answer should be. Because I know it, I read it in the paper.On the income side, you could argue that the score should be the median income, not the average.

"To add to that, celiac can be so bad that even the smallest cross contamination can be devastating.Think about it like this:You cut some raw chicken on a cutting board, then wipe(not wash) the cutting board and reuse it with something else.
That cutting board is now likely to contaminate anything else you put on it with salmonella.The same is true for gluten. While the effects of gluten contamination is not likely to be be fatal from one contamination, a celiac will be sick for the next week or two and causes lasting damage to the small intestine.Celiac is not cured, but with a totally gluten free diet within approx 5 years the damage to the villi has seen to be mostly healed (depends on the individual). Each contamination sets this back. Important to note that celiacs still must not ever have gluten even after the villi have recovered.My wife has celiac, I have a gluten sensitivity (causes migraines, brain fog, other intestinal issues). When we go out we just say we both have celiac.
So many restaurants claim to be be gluten conscious but really have no idea... Sometimes it's obvious (""hey, I can see that you put croutons on this and then took them off""), often not without seeing the kitchen, though.When we found out my wife has celiac we had to replace all of our cookware, toaster (obviously!... But didn't think about it at first), cooking utensils, pots and pans, etc.The good news of celiac is that it is easy to treat and feel much better relatively quickly.

"Interesting side aspect to the report is that Larkin and Lacey reside in Arizona and owned the New Times and Village Voice [1], they separated backpage content from those.Both the New Times and Village Voice are advocates on issues of civil rights and they cause lots of problems for authoritarian politicians and organizations trying to control people's lives [2][3]. Lacey and Larkin Fund is a huge supporter/funder of groups like ACLU and immigrant groups who donate heavily to civil right causes[2][6].Part of the attack on backpage is political in my opinion after looking at the facts.> Backpage started as the literal back page of the New Times, filled with classified ads.> Lacey and Larkin, former New Times executives who sold off the newspaper chain in 2012, retained the lucrative interest in the Backpage website.Both Larkin and Lacey are big civil right advocates and donate heavily to civil rights causes, sex rights, gay rights and immigrant rights [2][3] and the New Times attack politicians for corruption on the regular. After they attacked Arpaio they had nearly a decade of attacks from him and associated groups [5]. They did a strange tactic attacking Larkin and Lacey going after New Times readers.>In October 2007, Maricopa County sheriff's deputies arrested Lacey and Larkin on charges of revealing secret grand jury information concerning the investigations of the New Times's long-running feud with Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. In July 2004, the New Times published Arpaio's home address in the context of a story about his real estate dealings, which the County Attorney's office was investigating as a possible crime under Arizona state law. A special prosecutor served Village Voice Media with a subpoena ordering it to produce ""all documents"" related to the original real estate article, as well as ""all Internet web site traffic information"" to a number of articles that mentioned Arpaio. [5]Arpaio tried to get all information on all Phoenix New Times readers and the paper has been known to be tough on Arpaio overreaches in Arizona on immigrants and non-conservatives.> The prosecutor further ordered Village Voice Media to produce the IP addresses of all visitors to the Phoenix New Times website since January 1, 2004, as well as which websites those readers had been to prior to visiting. As an act of ""civil disobedience"", Lacey and Larkin published the contents of the subpoena on or about October 18, which resulted in their arrests the same day.On the following day, the county attorney dropped the case after declining to pursue charges against the two. [5]> The special prosecutor's subpoena included a demand for the names of all people who had read the Arpaio story on the newspaper's website. It was the revealing of the subpoena information by the New Times which led to the arrests. Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas dropped the charges less than 24 hours after the two were arrested [5]> In the weeks following the arrests, members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, of which the Phoenix New Times is a member, provided links on their websites to places where Arpaio's address could be found. This was done to show solidarity with the Phoenix New Times.[5]There is a strange section of the Backpage report attacking Lacey and Larkin for selling it to an outside investor who is offshore. They appear to hide ownership from them some might say wisely if it is being the whipping boy for 'trafficking' claims when really it is a sex worker ad website [4].> Third, despite the reported sale of Backpage to an undisclosed foreign company in 2014, the true beneficial owners of the company are James Larkin, Michael Lacey, and Carl Ferrer. Acting through a complex chain of domestic and
international shell companies, Lacey and Larkin lent Ferrer over $600 million to purchase Backpage from them. But as a result of this deal, Lacey and Larkin retain significant financial and operational control, hold almost complete debt equity in the company, and still receive large distributions of company profits. According to the consultant that structured the deal, moreover, this transaction appears to provide no tax benefits. Instead, it serves only to obscure Ferrer’s U.S.-based ownership and conceal Lacey and Larkin’s continued beneficial ownership.I'd say part of the attack on backpage is political and shuts down a big political donor for civil rights and typically liberal aims [2]. It seems them selling off the New Times, Village Voice and moving ownership overseas from 2012-2014 irked some politicians and authoritarians.The Backpage report claims of 'trafficking' amounts to simply a profanity filter that backpage created to PREVENT people posting bad ads or possible 'trafficking' not encouraging it [4].The report says Backpage 'knowingly concealed evidence of criminality' for removing bad terms being posted due to a profanity/word filter? They didn't want people posting ads with these terms because they were bad words, not that they supported it[4].That argument is like saying, because a site profanity filter removed racial slurs that the site was 'knowingly concealing evidence of racism'.The whole idea was to block it not some devious hiding scheme.  Understand backpage made lots of money, they wouldn't risk it for 'trafficking' and 'child trafficking' is such a reach that it just seems tacked on to the report with no evidence of it. Of course backpage doesn't want bad words posted to their ads, doesn't every classified site?New Times, Village Voice and by association, Backpage, have all been targets in Arizona by Arpaio, McCain and authoritarian orgs mainly because they are tough on authoritarian politicians including Trump, it seems there was more to this attack than what is stated in the report.The New Times has a history in being pro-civil rights and anti-war.> The Phoenix New Times is a free alternative weekly Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, published each Thursday. It was the founding publication of New Times Media (now Village Voice Media), but The Village Voice is now the flagship publication of that company.[5]The paper was founded in 1970 by a group of students at Arizona State University, led by Frank Fiore, Karen Lofgren, Michael Lacey, Bruce Stasium, Nick Stupey, Gayle Pyfrom, Hal Smith, and later, Jim Larkin, as a counterculture response to the Kent State shootings in the spring of that year. Gary Brennan played a role in its creation. According to the 20th Anniversary issue of the New Times, published on May 2, 1990, Fiore suggested that the anti-war crowd put out its own paper. The first summer issues were called the Arizona Times and assembled in the staff's La Crescenta apartments across from ASU. The Arizona Times was renamed the New Times as the first college issue went to press in September 1970.[5]New Times pushes civil rights and personal freedoms including ending marijuana prohibition and calls out prohibitionists in Arizona, as well as other causes for personal freedom [7].New Times has been kicking up dust on authoritarianism since the 70s. Lacey and Larkin also won a lawsuit against Arizona as recently as 2013 for false arrest which is still used to attack them [5].> In December 2013, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay Phoenix New Times founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin $3.75 million to settle their false arrest lawsuit against the county defendants.Take a look at their civil rights fund to see what I mean about how they take authority orgs/politicians to task and encourage civil rights [2]. They have been trying to take down the New Times, Village Voice Media and Backpage for nearly a decade and a half [5]. The whole report on Backpage, and their owners Lacey and Larkin who started New Times and Village Voice, might be a massive ad hominem [4]. It also appears to be an attack on owners of alternative media influence and funding for civil rights matters.My guess is Lacey and Larkin, civil rights fighters that seem similar to Larry Flynt[2], won't let this just happen and they'll fight it.

Then you don't have to blame your way of working. This is important. And I mean that solemnly. Your dignity is no laughing matter.> Second: keeping ourselves feeling irreplaceable involves cutting everybody else down to size, so don't miss an opportunity to undermine your employees' confidence.> A perfect opportunity comes when you're reviewing work that they've done. Use your authority to zero in immediately on all the things you can find wrong. Never never balance the negatives with positives, only criticize, just as your school teachers did.> Always remember: praise makes people uppity.> Third: Demand that people should always be actively doing things. If you catch anyone pondering, accuse them of laziness and/or indecision. This is to starve employees of thinking time because that leads to creativity and insurrection. So demand urgency at all times, use lots of fighting talk and war analogies, and establish a permanent atmosphere of stress, of breathless anxiety, and crisis.> In a phrase: keep that mode closed.> In this way we no-nonsense types can be sure that the tiny, tiny, microscopic quantity of creativity in our organization will all be ours!> But!

So he moves away. Nobody in his new town know's he's dildo guy, but then he goes out one night with this girl, and somebody exclaims omg it's that dildo guy, hey look at this everybody I got me some google skills, I saw this hilarious picture one time.Now on the one hand Eric has given the world a lot of (unpaid) entertainment as dildo guy, but on the other hand when he commits suicide because he is emotionally unconstituted to go through life being called out every now and then as dildo guy then he makes people feel bad. So in order to allow Eric to make his stupid drunk dildo hugging photo and not ruin the rest of his life for something embarrassing but totally legal let's just give him the right to remove the stuff from google. That way, when he moves from his old town where there are lots of people remembering the whole dildo picture situation, in his new town people didn't know him when it was fresh and his stupidity is somehow 'forgotten' thus preserving the ability that people have had throughout history of moving from one area because their reputation at that area had become to problematic to continue.

"Step 1: Start with simple circuits. And implement them on bread boards. Don't go for the printed circuit boards yet. There are many circuits out there for beginners. Choose one and implement it. Vary the elements in the circuit. For example if the circuit asks you to use 10k ohm resister use a 100 ohm resister and see what happens. In this case there might be drop in voltage(I believe, my memory is quite vague). To measure this you use multimeter. Learn how to do that. It is fundamental for any one wanting to play with electronics stuff. 
(P.S: If you are from India there is a magazine named ""Electronics for you"". If you have the money buy it. It is quite amazing. I haven't read it 6 years though so I don't know if the quality is still good)Step 2: Start reading the datasheets of different Integrated Circuits that you might use in your circuit. Its not that hard. Once you understand what Vcc, ground etc., are it becomes really easy.Step 3: Try and solder the the elements that you used on a board. Soldering is a basic skill that many engineers I know lack. It is good to know it. I have fixed many broken radios and other electronic items using this skill.Step 4: Start designing printed circuit boards on a software and send it to a company and print it(there are other means to do this too).Once you cover this, you can do a lot of really cool stuff with electronics. I hope this helps.Note: This makes you an amateur. Now if you want to learn about FPGAs and other stuff, then its gets a little tricky. You might need a book for that.",coldtea

"Interesting side aspect to the report is that Larkin and Lacey reside in Arizona and owned the New Times and Village Voice [1], they separated backpage content from those.Both the New Times and Village Voice are advocates on issues of civil rights and they cause lots of problems for authoritarian politicians and organizations trying to control people's lives [2][3]. Lacey and Larkin Fund is a huge supporter/funder of groups like ACLU and immigrant groups who donate heavily to civil right causes[2][6].Part of the attack on backpage is political in my opinion after looking at the facts.> Backpage started as the literal back page of the New Times, filled with classified ads.> Lacey and Larkin, former New Times executives who sold off the newspaper chain in 2012, retained the lucrative interest in the Backpage website.Both Larkin and Lacey are big civil right advocates and donate heavily to civil rights causes, sex rights, gay rights and immigrant rights [2][3] and the New Times attack politicians for corruption on the regular. After they attacked Arpaio they had nearly a decade of attacks from him and associated groups [5]. They did a strange tactic attacking Larkin and Lacey going after New Times readers.>In October 2007, Maricopa County sheriff's deputies arrested Lacey and Larkin on charges of revealing secret grand jury information concerning the investigations of the New Times's long-running feud with Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. In July 2004, the New Times published Arpaio's home address in the context of a story about his real estate dealings, which the County Attorney's office was investigating as a possible crime under Arizona state law. A special prosecutor served Village Voice Media with a subpoena ordering it to produce ""all documents"" related to the original real estate article, as well as ""all Internet web site traffic information"" to a number of articles that mentioned Arpaio. [5]Arpaio tried to get all information on all Phoenix New Times readers and the paper has been known to be tough on Arpaio overreaches in Arizona on immigrants and non-conservatives.> The prosecutor further ordered Village Voice Media to produce the IP addresses of all visitors to the Phoenix New Times website since January 1, 2004, as well as which websites those readers had been to prior to visiting. As an act of ""civil disobedience"", Lacey and Larkin published the contents of the subpoena on or about October 18, which resulted in their arrests the same day.On the following day, the county attorney dropped the case after declining to pursue charges against the two. [5]> The special prosecutor's subpoena included a demand for the names of all people who had read the Arpaio story on the newspaper's website. It was the revealing of the subpoena information by the New Times which led to the arrests. Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas dropped the charges less than 24 hours after the two were arrested [5]> In the weeks following the arrests, members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, of which the Phoenix New Times is a member, provided links on their websites to places where Arpaio's address could be found. This was done to show solidarity with the Phoenix New Times.[5]There is a strange section of the Backpage report attacking Lacey and Larkin for selling it to an outside investor who is offshore. They appear to hide ownership from them some might say wisely if it is being the whipping boy for 'trafficking' claims when really it is a sex worker ad website [4].> Third, despite the reported sale of Backpage to an undisclosed foreign company in 2014, the true beneficial owners of the company are James Larkin, Michael Lacey, and Carl Ferrer. Acting through a complex chain of domestic and
international shell companies, Lacey and Larkin lent Ferrer over $600 million to purchase Backpage from them. But as a result of this deal, Lacey and Larkin retain significant financial and operational control, hold almost complete debt equity in the company, and still receive large distributions of company profits. According to the consultant that structured the deal, moreover, this transaction appears to provide no tax benefits. Instead, it serves only to obscure Ferrer’s U.S.-based ownership and conceal Lacey and Larkin’s continued beneficial ownership.I'd say part of the attack on backpage is political and shuts down a big political donor for civil rights and typically liberal aims [2]. It seems them selling off the New Times, Village Voice and moving ownership overseas from 2012-2014 irked some politicians and authoritarians.The Backpage report claims of 'trafficking' amounts to simply a profanity filter that backpage created to PREVENT people posting bad ads or possible 'trafficking' not encouraging it [4].The report says Backpage 'knowingly concealed evidence of criminality' for removing bad terms being posted due to a profanity/word filter? They didn't want people posting ads with these terms because they were bad words, not that they supported it[4].That argument is like saying, because a site profanity filter removed racial slurs that the site was 'knowingly concealing evidence of racism'.The whole idea was to block it not some devious hiding scheme.  Understand backpage made lots of money, they wouldn't risk it for 'trafficking' and 'child trafficking' is such a reach that it just seems tacked on to the report with no evidence of it. Of course backpage doesn't want bad words posted to their ads, doesn't every classified site?New Times, Village Voice and by association, Backpage, have all been targets in Arizona by Arpaio, McCain and authoritarian orgs mainly because they are tough on authoritarian politicians including Trump, it seems there was more to this attack than what is stated in the report.The New Times has a history in being pro-civil rights and anti-war.> The Phoenix New Times is a free alternative weekly Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, published each Thursday. It was the founding publication of New Times Media (now Village Voice Media), but The Village Voice is now the flagship publication of that company.[5]The paper was founded in 1970 by a group of students at Arizona State University, led by Frank Fiore, Karen Lofgren, Michael Lacey, Bruce Stasium, Nick Stupey, Gayle Pyfrom, Hal Smith, and later, Jim Larkin, as a counterculture response to the Kent State shootings in the spring of that year. Gary Brennan played a role in its creation. According to the 20th Anniversary issue of the New Times, published on May 2, 1990, Fiore suggested that the anti-war crowd put out its own paper. The first summer issues were called the Arizona Times and assembled in the staff's La Crescenta apartments across from ASU. The Arizona Times was renamed the New Times as the first college issue went to press in September 1970.[5]New Times pushes civil rights and personal freedoms including ending marijuana prohibition and calls out prohibitionists in Arizona, as well as other causes for personal freedom [7].New Times has been kicking up dust on authoritarianism since the 70s. Lacey and Larkin also won a lawsuit against Arizona as recently as 2013 for false arrest which is still used to attack them [5].> In December 2013, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay Phoenix New Times founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin $3.75 million to settle their false arrest lawsuit against the county defendants.Take a look at their civil rights fund to see what I mean about how they take authority orgs/politicians to task and encourage civil rights [2]. They have been trying to take down the New Times, Village Voice Media and Backpage for nearly a decade and a half [5]. The whole report on Backpage, and their owners Lacey and Larkin who started New Times and Village Voice, might be a massive ad hominem [4]. It also appears to be an attack on owners of alternative media influence and funding for civil rights matters.My guess is Lacey and Larkin, civil rights fighters that seem similar to Larry Flynt[2], won't let this just happen and they'll fight it. Most of the attacks on Backpage, and previously the New Times and Village Voice, attacks their character via ad hominems because they are causing trouble for authoritarians and pushing alternative news media funding, my guess is this takedown of Backpage is no different.[1] https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2018/04/0...[2] http://www.laceyandlarkinfronterafund.org/[3] http://www.phoenixmag.com/valley-news/i-fought-the-law-and.h...[4] https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Backpage%20Report...[5] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_New_Times[6] https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/0...[7] http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/here-are-the-prohibition...",psyc

"> The simplified executive line of reasoning, why to rather trust an external entity over their own people, goes usually along these lines: ""We do not take advice from our employees. We hired them for grunt work and we only expect them to follow orders. What could they possibly know that could benefit our high-level decision making. Afterall we pay them so little"".It's not always that leadership ignores line-engineers just because they consider them stupid. Even obvious recommendations get tangled into the web of politics and personal favors. Sometimes the 'obvious solution' is also a play to get more power or influence for someone you're opposed to. That factors into how the advice is taken.Part of the fiction management sells itself is consultants can cut across those organizational boundaries and find the 'right solution'. Sometimes having an 'impartial' voice echoing what others have already said is enough to convince you it's not just someone trying to poach your turf, it's actually good advice.Further, our tendencies towards tribalism influence this process. We tend not to think of other employees as part of the same group - they are devs, or ops, or product. That builds an 'us vs. them' mentality that's hard to break. Bringing in an outsider tends to unify the group into us (the company/team) vs. the outsider (the consultant). That psychology helps us to justify bitter medicine like our team getting more work (which will help the company).I tend to have a negative opinion of consultants, but someone pointed this aspect of group psychology to me in the past and it resonated.",minikites

"I get the impression this is much more likely to happen when one group of elites gets the country into an economic situation that will make them lose their power. In a way, they fucked up, but of course they don't see things that way. (I have never read in the history books about an elite that saw their actions justified by economic results. No their actions are ""from God"", ""noble"", ""good for the planet"", ""socially just"", ""for the plebs"", ... and so on. None of them accept the judgement that comes from the real world in terms of economic performance, in fact usually right before they lose power they attempt to falsify economic indicators on a very large scale, because at least some of them do realize that their justifications are bullshit and the result in the real world is all that matters. Those results are usually less than perfect)Then the old elites and the powerless masses have something in common : they need the government to repress things with a heavy hand. The elites need the government to repress people, because otherwise their power is under threat, or even their persons. The powerless masses want the government to be heavy-handed because they want all the shenanigans and ""gentlemen's agreements"" that exist with the elites blown up, and they want their newly elected people to have the power to blow those up.You see a sort of mini version happening currently. Both the middle Americans that elected him and the Bay Area progressives that hate him want Trump to have more power. Obviously things like legislating solutions to ""fake news"" are very, very bad for both of them, yet they both want it. I even understand how the reasoning works, and where they're both very very wrong.The progressives want heavy handed government because ""they're right"" (they mostly are, of course, but) and the population just doesn't see that. So we must legislate and put rules for what the population sees, hears, and so on. Otherwise climate change action, future democratic/progressive politics, open borders, ... and so on are all in great danger.... except of course with Donald Trump in charge of enforcement actions for this ... things are not going to go well for these causes regardless of the heavy hand. And the rights and powers that the executive power acquires as a result of this legislation ... will be aimed straight at them.The middle Americans are tired of being marginalized and not listened to. They want their jobs (their industries) protected and left alone. They want limits on imports. Imports of people that complete on the job market, and imports of goods that put their employers out of business.... except of course automation means this is useless. Furthermore, economically speaking these limits will lead to inflation, and they'll be the last ones to get wage increases. So if this indeed happens (as it appears it will) it will make their situation that much worse, not better. And of course that heavy hand will lead to more government bureaucrats interference in their lives and companies, not less.",JoeAltmaier
"The article is very illuminating on how the licensing on the technology side. But I am confused. First it said:This approach had advantages for everyone involved.

"Anecdote time.Just for background story before I come to the music:I had chronic heavy metal poisoning diagnosed almost a decade ago (fortunately I had all relevant values - hair, blood, urine significantly elevated, usually chronic exposure is much harder to prove). Using chelators for years I got amazing recoveries, for example, for a few months each time after getting a chelator IV (DMPS, DMSA) the area around the side of my thyroid was ""working"". It was the side that was double-sied with a cold nodule, tested and seen decades ago and again just before the chelation treatments started (going to the endocrinologist again was part of my desperate search for answers that ended when I finally had the crazy idea it might be heavy metals, something only ""crazy people"" think, but which the lab results fortunately supported). The nodule had disappeared and the thyroid was normal size when I had the endocrinologist do another UV check because I had that crazy idea that what happened through chelation was just that miracle.Anyway, to the music (slowly).My brain for long periods of time was not very usable. Lots of ""brain fog"", stuff that I had firmly in my hands falling out, periods where I crashed into every obstacle in my flat for no apparent reason, hands shaking when I was holding my kindle (had to hold it with two hands), lots of word finding issues, extreme focus on details combined with an ability to let go - very disturbing, for example, when (without wanting to) you concentrate on a tiny insignificant detail and cannot think of anything else, this one thing races through your head for hours, and believe me, I'm not talking about anything reasonable or sane here, it is quite extreme. After a few years my brain was doing very very strange things, but with experience of years I knew it now was on the path to recovery. I needed LOTS of time, lying down, and the brain would do very strange things that I cannot describe but which are definitely not part of normal life.During that time the one thing that helped me was music. My brain needed music! The beat (""time""), the melody. Especially the timing aspect. Music was medicine. And I'm not talking about some ""nice to have"" psychological needs, I'm talking about a hard requirement. The right music held my brain together and helped it get or remain organized. Of course, I making that statement ""by feel"", I wasn't hooked up to an EEG, I have no proof, just my own experience. I did take several neuroscience courses (the best one the big one from Duke on Coursera by an excellent teacher[0]) and lots of anatomy, physiology, statistics), during the last few years, but obviously no scientific rigor was applied to the stories of my own experience.I didn't have music running all the time. in fact I loathe ""background music"". I needed it during certain times, especially during the first half of the day, and I would go for a walk and with good inner-ear headsets concentrate on the music. Having it play in the background when I'm doing something else would not have helped at all, quite the opposite, my ability to endure distractions was very limited during those years. I did (involuntarily, broken equipment) perform tests of how I would fare with and without the music. I felt much worse without.I'm not talking about the usual ""helps you in a bad mood"" kind of benefit. It's impossible to convey unfortunately, I never did and by now I don't have any more the need for that kind of help from music, so I suspect the vast majority of people won't ever experience something similar in their lives.These days I can easily not listen to music for days, but during the height of my ""strange brain activities"" I could not, as I said, music was medicine (for my brain).So the article does not surprise me because I had already concluded such a relationship, including why different people will react very differently.PS: By the way, I think we can all agree that the Russian Dance from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is the best piece of music ever written, right? :-) [1][0] https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience[1] https://youtu.be/5wOBNjgCg6M (not actually my favorite peformance, but I could not find the one that I like most so easily)",kome

"I get the impression this is much more likely to happen when one group of elites gets the country into an economic situation that will make them lose their power. In a way, they fucked up, but of course they don't see things that way. (I have never read in the history books about an elite that saw their actions justified by economic results. No their actions are ""from God"", ""noble"", ""good for the planet"", ""socially just"", ""for the plebs"", ... and so on. None of them accept the judgement that comes from the real world in terms of economic performance, in fact usually right before they lose power they attempt to falsify economic indicators on a very large scale, because at least some of them do realize that their justifications are bullshit and the result in the real world is all that matters. Those results are usually less than perfect)Then the old elites and the powerless masses have something in common : they need the government to repress things with a heavy hand. The elites need the government to repress people, because otherwise their power is under threat, or even their persons. The powerless masses want the government to be heavy-handed because they want all the shenanigans and ""gentlemen's agreements"" that exist with the elites blown up, and they want their newly elected people to have the power to blow those up.You see a sort of mini version happening currently. Both the middle Americans that elected him and the Bay Area progressives that hate him want Trump to have more power. Obviously things like legislating solutions to ""fake news"" are very, very bad for both of them, yet they both want it. I even understand how the reasoning works, and where they're both very very wrong.The progressives want heavy handed government because ""they're right"" (they mostly are, of course, but) and the population just doesn't see that. So we must legislate and put rules for what the population sees, hears, and so on. Otherwise climate change action, future democratic/progressive politics, open borders, ... and so on are all in great danger.... except of course with Donald Trump in charge of enforcement actions for this ... things are not going to go well for these causes regardless of the heavy hand. And the rights and powers that the executive power acquires as a result of this legislation ... will be aimed straight at them.The middle Americans are tired of being marginalized and not listened to. They want their jobs (their industries) protected and left alone. They want limits on imports. Imports of people that complete on the job market, and imports of goods that put their employers out of business.... except of course automation means this is useless. Furthermore, economically speaking these limits will lead to inflation, and they'll be the last ones to get wage increases. So if this indeed happens (as it appears it will) it will make their situation that much worse, not better. And of course that heavy hand will lead to more government bureaucrats interference in their lives and companies, not less.",xorcist
"The article is very illuminating on how the licensing on the technology side. But I am confused. First it said:This approach had advantages for everyone involved. It meant licensees and Qualcomm didn't have to scrap over which parts of the phone did or didn't use Qualcomm technology, so they could just go ahead and focus on the more important task of developing and selling these hip new gadgets.And then:Qualcomm's argument was that no matter what went in the phones, they wouldn't work at all without its technology.So, was the current licensing agreements put in place because it was advantageous for everyone or was it because Qualcomm argued that the company's technology enabled mobiles? The reasoning is important because if it was former then wouldn't removing the current licensing structure remove the intended ""simplicity"".

"Anecdote time.Just for background story before I come to the music:I had chronic heavy metal poisoning diagnosed almost a decade ago (fortunately I had all relevant values - hair, blood, urine significantly elevated, usually chronic exposure is much harder to prove). Using chelators for years I got amazing recoveries, for example, for a few months each time after getting a chelator IV (DMPS, DMSA) the area around the side of my thyroid was ""working"". It was the side that was double-sied with a cold nodule, tested and seen decades ago and again just before the chelation treatments started (going to the endocrinologist again was part of my desperate search for answers that ended when I finally had the crazy idea it might be heavy metals, something only ""crazy people"" think, but which the lab results fortunately supported). The nodule had disappeared and the thyroid was normal size when I had the endocrinologist do another UV check because I had that crazy idea that what happened through chelation was just that miracle.Anyway, to the music (slowly).My brain for long periods of time was not very usable. Lots of ""brain fog"", stuff that I had firmly in my hands falling out, periods where I crashed into every obstacle in my flat for no apparent reason, hands shaking when I was holding my kindle (had to hold it with two hands), lots of word finding issues, extreme focus on details combined with an ability to let go - very disturbing, for example, when (without wanting to) you concentrate on a tiny insignificant detail and cannot think of anything else, this one thing races through your head for hours, and believe me, I'm not talking about anything reasonable or sane here, it is quite extreme. After a few years my brain was doing very very strange things, but with experience of years I knew it now was on the path to recovery. I needed LOTS of time, lying down, and the brain would do very strange things that I cannot describe but which are definitely not part of normal life.During that time the one thing that helped me was music. My brain needed music! The beat (""time""), the melody. Especially the timing aspect. Music was medicine. And I'm not talking about some ""nice to have"" psychological needs, I'm talking about a hard requirement. The right music held my brain together and helped it get or remain organized. Of course, I making that statement ""by feel"", I wasn't hooked up to an EEG, I have no proof, just my own experience. I did take several neuroscience courses (the best one the big one from Duke on Coursera by an excellent teacher[0]) and lots of anatomy, physiology, statistics), during the last few years, but obviously no scientific rigor was applied to the stories of my own experience.I didn't have music running all the time. in fact I loathe ""background music"". I needed it during certain times, especially during the first half of the day, and I would go for a walk and with good inner-ear headsets concentrate on the music. Having it play in the background when I'm doing something else would not have helped at all, quite the opposite, my ability to endure distractions was very limited during those years. I did (involuntarily, broken equipment) perform tests of how I would fare with and without the music. I felt much worse without.I'm not talking about the usual ""helps you in a bad mood"" kind of benefit. It's impossible to convey unfortunately, I never did and by now I don't have any more the need for that kind of help from music, so I suspect the vast majority of people won't ever experience something similar in their lives.These days I can easily not listen to music for days, but during the height of my ""strange brain activities"" I could not, as I said, music was medicine (for my brain).So the article does not surprise me because I had already concluded such a relationship, including why different people will react very differently.PS: By the way, I think we can all agree that the Russian Dance from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is the best piece of music ever written, right? :-) [1][0] https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience[1] https://youtu.be/5wOBNjgCg6M (not actually my favorite peformance, but I could not find the one that I like most so easily)",pavs

"I think it really depends on whether the neurons responsible for handling vision processing have any natural spatial processing ability. It's not obvious to me whether they would or not. My guess is that allowing some time to look around the objects (without being told which is which and without touching them), that they would be able to create spatial relationships for vision processing (sensorimotor loop) and be able to overcome this issue. Once there is some spatial reasoning for the two different types of input, I believe they would begin to build correlations between them (only for very simple shapes).Perhaps an experiment could be made that would answer this by giving a person a completely new sense and asking the same identification problem. I think the skin could be interesting to use as it allows 2D input with the possibility of utilizing existing spatial mapping, yet isn't used (in most cases) for 2D depth feedback. You could attach some device that heats/cools, pokes, pinches or something else to excite nerves based on some depth information. Of course they would be blindfolded and unable to touch the objects.You could make two different types of experiment, one that has spatial mapping to the skin and another that is randomly linked, seeing how long (if at all) it takes for somebody to figure out from the inputs which shape they are observing.My guess is that they could quickly get an intuition for each shape simply by looking at the rate of change of inputs when they move about the object.",mpfundstein

"That's an argument that Qualcomm would push.  If Qualcomm charged a flat $25/phone, that would hugely drive up the price of low-cost phones.  However, why should Qualcomm get more money if a manufacturer includes a better display or camera?  Qualcomm isn't adding more value, the better display or camera is adding the additional value.  Qualcomm is just demanding more money.Microsoft is saying that Windows makes a computer better by $N and so manufacturers need to pay that.  If you sell a computer with an integrated monitor (rather than an external display), there's no reason for Microsoft to get more money.One big difference between Microsoft and Qualcomm's situation is that technologies like CDMA, UMTS, and LTE are official standards that only use patents from those willing to commit to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory).  Microsoft never agreed to FRAND licensing while Qualcomm did.Because Qualcomm wants a percentage of the selling price, it refuses to license the patents to, say, Intel or MediaTek.  If they licensed the patents to Intel, Qualcomm couldn't then ask for royalties from Apple on devices that use the Intel modem.  For example, when you buy an iPhone, Qualcomm can't come up to you and say, ""you're using our patents so you owe us money.""  Likewise, if you sell the iPhone to someone else, they similarly can't ask for money from that person.  But Qualcomm wants to get a percentage of Apple's selling price, not a percentage of Intel's selling price on the modem alone.You brought up Microsoft's practice of requiring an OEM that uses Windows on some machines to pay for Windows for all machines, even ones shipped without Windows.  In fact, Qualcomm has a similar arrangement called ""no license-no chips"".  If you want access to Qualcomm's modems for your high-end phones, you must agree to elevated royalty rates for Qualcomm's patents even on your devices that don't use Qualcomm chips.Much of the information in this comment comes from: https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/170117qualc....

It is generally accepted that about 80% of Chinese published economic indicators from public institutions are outright fabrication. If you look further into this and what it means, it is baffling. They are lies, and not just lies, but they are lies by people who do not themselves know the true numbers.About the whole financial community is convinced that the Chinese government itself has no idea about the economic performance of the country because of this pervasive and onmipresent falsification.In one famous case, a local governor from Mongolia is known to have promised to reduce steel producing capacity by about 20%. Not only did he not do it. He lied about it, and it took the central government about 4 years to realize it had happened (or at least, took 4 years before it was even mentioned anywhere).The attitude in China must change.

Once there is some spatial reasoning for the two different types of input, I believe they would begin to build correlations between them (only for very simple shapes).Perhaps an experiment could be made that would answer this by giving a person a completely new sense and asking the same identification problem. I think the skin could be interesting to use as it allows 2D input with the possibility of utilizing existing spatial mapping, yet isn't used (in most cases) for 2D depth feedback. You could attach some device that heats/cools, pokes, pinches or something else to excite nerves based on some depth information. Of course they would be blindfolded and unable to touch the objects.You could make two different types of experiment, one that has spatial mapping to the skin and another that is randomly linked, seeing how long (if at all) it takes for somebody to figure out from the inputs which shape they are observing.My guess is that they could quickly get an intuition for each shape simply by looking at the rate of change of inputs when they move about the object.",solarkraft
"At what speeds? I'm in NYC, similar dense road systems. At a reasonable speed, snapping still works because it knows where you came from. In stop stop stop go traffic combined with lane weaving and ramp merging I've found it is not hard to trick the gps into thinking you're on a parallel access road or unrelated ramp for a little while.It's possible your highways are newer or less congested than ours?",visarga
